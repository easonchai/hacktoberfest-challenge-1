üêç **Python** challenge for Hacktoberfest 2020

## Rules üìú
- Each person should try to solve just one issue *(Save some of the fun for others!)*
- Once you solve an issue, edit the **Fixed section** below with the issue you fixed and open a Pull Request (PR)
    - *Example*
    - [x] Add documentation for Mac users
- Don't destroy anything important in this section!
- Have fun and support other open source projects!

## Fixed ‚úÖ
- Bug on create() -> email query commented + element not inserted on database properly :D
- [x] Example fix, copy this as a template!

## Getting Started üó∫Ô∏è
- There are 5 bugs üï∑Ô∏è found in the source code of the Python project. Find it, solve it, and open a PR!
- There are **additional freebie pull requests** you can claim by modifying this README file and:
    - Add instructions
    - Fix typos
    - Be creative! (e.g. What is Hacktoberfest about?)
- Not interested in fixing the README? Modify the source code! Add comments, refactor code, mess around!

- ### Instructions
    - Recommended path:
        - Fork repository into your own profile (Fork button on top-right corner)
        - Clone forked repository into your local machine:
            - Download as zip (not really useful)
            - Clone through git directly with: git clone <url> (on windows)
        - Modify the repository as you see fit
        - Ask for a Pull Request through the button on your forked repository's page!    

You are encouraged to improve on the source code because that is where your creativity shines and the possibilities are endless!
