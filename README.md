## Getting Started 🗺️

- There are **additional freebie pull requests** you can claim by modifying this README file and:
    - Add instructions
    - Fix typos
    - Be creative! (e.g. What is Hacktoberfest about?)
- Not interested in fixing the README? Modify the source code! Add comments, refactor code, mess around!
